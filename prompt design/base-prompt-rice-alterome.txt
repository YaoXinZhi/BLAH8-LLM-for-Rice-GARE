We define "genetic alteration caused regulatory event" as defined below.
A genetic alteration occurs in a specific gene, then the alteration further caused the regulation of a downstream biological process.

An example:
Sent-1: 32449922 Among the 11 ZF-HD genes in rice, the overexpression of OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induces leaf curling by controlling the number and arrangement The overexpression of OsZHD1 and OsZHD2 induces leaf curling by controlling the number and arrangement of bulliform cells.
chain-1: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- induces -- leaf curling
chain-2: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- induces -- leaf curling
chain-3: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- controlling -- number of bulliform cells
chain-4: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- controlling -- number of bulliform cells
chain-5: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- induces -- leaf curling
chain-6: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- controlling -- number of bulliform cells
chain-7: OsZHD1 -- overexpression -- controlling -- arrangement of bulliform cells
chain-8: OsZHD2 -- overexpression -- controlling -- arrangement of bulliform cells

Please extract the events from the following sentences, and only return the result in the same format as the example.
sent-1: 20838584 Therefore, overexpression of EUI causes a dwarf phenotype whereas mutation within this gene increases the internode length in rice.
sent-2: 20385831 Rice lines silenced for Xb24 display enhanced XA21-mediated immunity, whereas rice lines overexpressing XB24 are compromised for immunity.
sent-3: 21209026 Introduction of the semi-dominant Bc6 mutant gene into wild-type rice significantly reduced the percentage of cellulose, causing brittle phenotypes.
sent-4: 21963665 Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation.
sent-5: 21807436 Knockdown of OsPAO and OsRCCR1 cause different plant death phenotypes in rice.
